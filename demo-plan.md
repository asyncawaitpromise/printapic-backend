# Project Plan: PrintAPic Backend Enhancement

## Overview
This document outlines the development plan for enhancing the PrintAPic backend service with new features and improvements.

## Objectives
- Implement user authentication system
- Add image processing capabilities
- Create order management system
- Integrate payment processing

## Phase 1: Authentication System
### Tasks
1. **User Registration**
   - Create user model
   - Implement registration endpoint
   - Add email verification
   
2. **User Login**
   - JWT token implementation
   - Login endpoint
   - Password hashing with bcrypt

3. **Authorization Middleware**
   - Protected routes
   - Role-based access control

### Timeline: 2 weeks

## Phase 2: Image Processing
### Features
- Image upload handling
- Format conversion (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- Resize and compression
- Thumbnail generation

### Technologies
- **Multer** for file uploads
- **Sharp** for image processing
- **AWS S3** for storage

### Timeline: 3 weeks

## Phase 3: Order Management
### Components
1. Order creation and tracking
2. Status updates
3. Order history
4. Customer notifications

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    status VARCHAR(50),
    total_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Timeline: 2 weeks

## Phase 4: Payment Integration
### Payment Providers
- Stripe integration
- PayPal support
- Webhook handling

### Security Considerations
- PCI compliance
- Secure token handling
- Transaction logging

### Timeline: 2 weeks

## Technical Requirements
- Node.js 18+
- Express.js framework
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis for caching
- Docker for containerization

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| API rate limiting | High | Implement caching strategy |
| Database performance | Medium | Query optimization |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Regular security audits |

## Success Metrics
- API response time < 200ms
- 99.9% uptime
- Zero security incidents
- Customer satisfaction > 95%

## Conclusion
This plan provides a structured approach to enhancing the PrintAPic backend with essential features while maintaining high performance and security standards.
